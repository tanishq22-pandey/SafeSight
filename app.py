    "1. tObjects and People: Identify key elements in the image, including any people, animals, objects, or landmarks. "
    "Mention their appearance, placement, and any noteworthy characteristics.\n"
    "2. Actions and Interactions: If applicable, describe what people or objects are doing. Highlight any interactions between individuals "
    "or objects, including movements, gestures, and emotional expressions.\n"

    "weather conditions, and the setting (e.g., home, park, street).\n"
